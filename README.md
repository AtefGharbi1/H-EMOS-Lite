# H-EMOS-Lite
This repository provides the code and datasets used in the paper:
"An Adaptive Multi-Layer Heuristic Framework for Real-Time Energy Optimization in Smart Grids".

## Data
The datasets provided in the `datadir/` folder correspond to the processed
and reproducible demand, price, and grid data used in all experiments.
They emulate realistic residential energy system characteristics and are
released to ensure full reproducibility.

## Reproducing results
Run the following command:
python h_emos_lite_with_baselines.py
